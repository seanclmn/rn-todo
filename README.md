# Todo app with React Native + Expo

#### Tech stack

This is a react native project written in typescript. It is a simple todo app with CRUD functionality. 
Firebase is used for user authentication and backend data storage.
React Navigation was used for some basic routing, and React Native Elements was used for some components.

#### Instructions
Once you have cloned this repository, go to the ```todo-app``` directory, and run ```npm install``` to install all the necessary dependencies. You will also need to insert the .env file from me, into the root of the ```todo-app``` directory.

To run the app, run ```npx expo start```. Follow the instructions in your terminal to run the app on an iphone or android simulator. If you want to run it in the browser, make sure to use Node version 16 is recommended - any version higher will fail.
